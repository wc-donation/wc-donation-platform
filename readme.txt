=== Donation Platform for WooCommerce: Fundraising & Donation Management: Motivation ===

Why does the world need this WooCommerce donation plugin?
Hands down, WooCommerce is the most mature eCommerce solution. It is supported by all other major systems (CRM, Analytics, Marketing, Accounting and more) and offers numerous possibilities to customize the behavior to your needs.

So it doesn't make sense to reprogram all the features already implemented by WooCommerce for a donation and fundraising platform again and worse. Instead, you just customize the look and in some places the behavior of WooCommerce and you get a comprehensive fundraising, crowdfunding, crowdsourcing and donation solution for your charity.

= Will my theme work with Donation Platform for WooCommerce: Fundraising & Donation Management? =

Probably. Unfortunately, many themes add a lot of custom styles to the WooCommerce checkout, some of them may compete with the CSS of Donation Platform for WooCommerce: Fundraising & Donation Management and you get weird results.

= Will my WooCommerce extension work with Donation Platform for WooCommerce: Fundraising & Donation Management? =

Probably. I cannot test every WooCommerce extension out there. Donation Platform for WooCommerce: Fundraising & Donation Management uses WooCommerce filters & actions to change the behaviour and appearance of WooCommerce. When other plugins also use these hooks they may interfere with each other.

No. For now, it primarily focuses on customer facing behaviour and appearance that is crucial for the donation & fundraising platform.
